This is a remaster of the AE2lang utility initially publish on [byblo](https://byblo.proboards.com/thread/23/tool-ae2lang-language-file-converter) ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512182837/https://byblo.proboards.com/thread/101/tool-ae1map-editor-version-20090913)). It is rewritten to eliminate unnecessary `goto`s and improve readability. The written version can be compiled using [`gcc`](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
